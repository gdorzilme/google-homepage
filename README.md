# The Google Homepage

This project is a simple Google.com homepage which demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills including the use of the Flexbox model. In developing this simple webpage, I learned how to apply the basic fundamentals of CSS Flexbox to center elements on the page, and create horizontal navigation links in the header and footer of the page.
